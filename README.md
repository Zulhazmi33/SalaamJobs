# SalaamJobs

This is a group project that was done by 4 member. 

My part in this system is :
staff_jobCareer.html/staff_calendar.html/graduate_jobCareer.html/graduate_calendar.html/login.html/register.html

You can choose to import the zip file into netbean. And click run on the login.html

But if you dont wish to import, or version is not compatible. You can directly open the file

Click src->main->webapp->starter->login.html
